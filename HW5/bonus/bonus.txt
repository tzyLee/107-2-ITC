tyranny tyranny based citizen terror victory defeat before shot fired interesting article good see widening participation debate suggest move one step further own bombs bullets only shatter peace because invading foreign nations imprisoning innocent hunting shadows cannot destroy evil mind hatred within heart rather than focusing upon effect should consider cause because terrorism does begin bombs try foreign policy compassion only enhance democracy share freedom agree frederick forsyth really t deal terrorism turning britain fascist state what really need honesty security services politicians evidence bring well trial there probably isn t any security services behave are detective having decided certain person guilty rakes over all kinds obscure flimsy evidence try prove while real villain gets away remember there done no wmd iraq just because person may made some stupid naive decisions life does make terrorist overly politically correct society good see someone are forsyth

apathetic some times just let without telling government no however nation gave world common law true sense rights individual liberty hope prove one step too far somebody chinese origin say country used good place migrate start new life whilst life wasn t perfect could make better ourselves now riddled red tape told what cannot politically correct allowed beliefs opinions prime minister spends too much time meddling politics affairs little lives british citizens home abroad forsyth done good job voicing opinions let hope bbc doesn t get gagged letting well express views well right know bbc role inform educate entertain agree terrorists intend spread fear reality government spread fear constant publicising invisible enemy so dangerous must allow ride roughshod over rights liberties end very thing seek protect what giving name safety invisible enemy terrorists already won absolutely agree frederick forsyth yes defend ourselves against terrorism existing laws seem than adequate idea new terrorism demands new powers erroneous evidence any real terrorist capability uk scant ricin example dangerous poison weapon mass destruction what really worrying enthusiasm blair government authoritarian reactions attempts manipulate electorate are fear government way id cards tracking so then totalitarianism won such then matters little whether give terrorists demands lost precious freedom bush blair constantly tells seek bring others agree wholeheartedly forsyth shocked ease government prepared wipe out major portion liberties british well enjoyed centuries right deprived liberty without trial open court goes right back magna carta ordinary well spilled blood enforce right against governments thought knew best your look today britain your realise george orwell only wrong one thing date frederick forsyth puts beautifully government seeking introduce police state new powers home internment without trial follow pattern includes introduction surveillance via compulsory id cards linking data bases together un british idea swear allegiance state age 18 years sleep walking wake interesting view missing two crucial facts new threat 1 terrorists acquire weapons mass destruction use without fear mutually assured destruction kept cold war state tense balance well use devastating force against without fear any consequence 2 terrorists prepared use suicide bombers means could kill innocent well london underground could very little stop because terrorists potentially so deadly come new tougher responses little late day well outside london wake one morning find out london nuked won t much society left debate correct most what says mind your does seem forgotten disgraceful internment policy northern ireland probably caused many idealistic misguided young catholics join ira administrative detention muslims could similar effect now surely public better protected security services rather than alerting suspect terrorist placing under house arrest how long done place suspect terrorist under surveillance maybe acquire sufficient evidence prosecute even better prevent terrorist attack don t usually much time forsyth largely right wing views time got spot there no doubt there terrorist organisations are harm u k very doubtful whether al qaeda global organisation co ordinating rise surveillance cameras id cards plan charge road use tracking every vehicle all times stuff nightmares add this new legislation effectively means protection law removed anyone whim home secretary genuinely wonder what sort world my two children inherit where end stands terrorists need attack u k government soon well terrorised could very achieve few bombs forsyth expressed exactly what my gut fears reservations done proposed legislation could verbalise thank your forsyth seems forget killings troubles occurred both sides religious divide carried out killers both sides forgets basic human rights done suspended then now experienced judges sat over some greatest miscarriages justice during those times very little return maximum alienation laws emphasis islamic threat just same forsyth wrong nature current threat new no longer armed forces soviet threat eastern bloc your terrorist aim kill indiscriminately best comparison therefore blitz 1941 time let forget suspects foreign british done routinely rounded interned duration war without any complaints public must forget war d say that arelihood attack sleeper cell fundamentalist lunatics against major uk target probability ll bet any money your are day after any such attack freddie forsyth saying government didn t enough protect uk well are forsyth only see one side any argument side opposite new labour tony blair agree wholeheartedly forsyth very reason country such wonderful place live under attack terrorists government perpetuation perceived terrorist threat because what alleged terrorists doing own government believe what government doing very least highly questionable worst sinister what point feel enough control over every single person british isles all tagged monitored constantly freedom being craftily surreptitiously whittled away government gaining nothing should great concern everyone slightly older than forsyth therefore lived are same history against police state are think lived one think attack iraq made international situation worse may provoked further acts terrorism how true there extremely worrying parallels between britain now germany during 30 never thought so easy take over country within forsyth forgotten one key point terrorists threaten britain today well aware hitler stalin ira all failed result modern day terrorists willing things predecessors does mean civil liberties modern britain must eroded counter threat should always absolute last resort meet new threat defeat sinister fanaticism today terrorists may need things little differently let hope frederic forsythe comments seem me well thought out analysis human society whole britain particular should resist temptation over protect are fear fear enables terrorists succeed end terrorists come all forms forsythe opening comments suggest reminded quote attributed thomas jefferson nation limits freedom name security neither government faced incredibly difficult task made policy deal all very well criticising policy forsythe t draw years experience offer alternative say so what opinions frederick forsyth rhetoric absurd conclusions laughable distorts reality serve own prejudice against new labour government seeks balance protection democracy minimum loss civil rights frederick forsyth extremist because does appreciate need balance rarely find myself agreeing my forsyth instance think correct rule law must prevail civil liberties worth defending government hold suspects without charge trial what next agree absolutely introducing fascist type laws loose moral high ground fight against terror democratic system perfect churchill points out better than all others tried terrorist attacks take place many reasons should take personal risk return personal freedom usually agree forsyth spot here single biggest threat face government dedicated acting illegally manipulating international national law suit own purpose totalitarianism always requires outside threat justifying range extraordinary powers leaders british government far greater threat terrorist organisation although principle agree frederick forsyth fails address one key point al qaeda attacks though obviously there none yet uk seek kill maximum number well ira wanted limit death toll attacks so maintain support among republican movement yes agree forsyth views believe government plans justified there over reaction negative influence president interpretation democracy freedom uses same arguments done current before wwii wars liberate iraq afghanistan syria iran come leaving poor inheritance future generations forsyth wonderful writer should keep fiction where belongs british government going down road forsyth suggests sadly comments such make lot well believe governed well fast becoming tyrants instead being genuinely committed stopping tyranny even method employed moment alien british well lived democracy protected tony blair others are mind forsyth seems putting along side scruffy little austrian thomas hobbes smiling grave labour propositions are new labour called himself libertarian are new labour believed promoting well best interests forsythe criticises government hobbes criticised most subsequent philosophers arguing way hands totalitarians simply put argued favour ultimate liberty liberty live man should prepared surrender all liberties supreme sovereign protection against fellow barbaric man hobbes roundly condemned posterity rightly so hope new labour suffers same treatment agree forsyth views governments approach totally against spirit british democracy must allowed get away course frederick wrong britain winning war against ira wrong too country becoming tyranny forgotten shoot kill torture internment without trial collusion loyalist death squads etc my background somewhat similar freddie so persuaded agree many sentiments no moral justification imposing system government anyone while systematically depriving own citizens basic individual collective freedoms whilst principle keeping potential terrorists under house arrest might seem superficially attractive unfortunately first step towards totalitarianism decide whom suspect should believe faith honesty integrity competence intelligence services politicians light events recent years what stop false denunciations what those falsely accused lose careers support families children still school smacks me methods nazi germany stalin russia ceausescu romania list goes looks new dark age coming see opinion forsyth remarks divided problem see those support imprisonment without trial believe never happen family only well don t are scared history shown your laws are always get abused those power after all today your may scared same well those power someday those power may scared your day your ll one imprisoned without chance justice laws such your cannot just imprisoned whim police forces your shown deserving imprison well without trial indeterminate period no better those fighting never thought possible me agree single word uttered frederick forsyth m wholehearted agreement one nation grave danger being duped pro propaganda course means ll inherit most all total paranoia allow governments any political persuasion incidentally gradually insidiously impose police state well tried tested back door methods grieve future my children no wonder re adamant don t ever any own government much fanfare signs european convention human rights now wants introduce indefinite house arrest without trial puts par government burma are many your respondents wouldn t usually think forsyth someone whose views share instance opposing charles clark proposals house arrest agree wholeheartedly forsyth agree forsyth just look facts government along invaded another sovereign country iraq selecting intelligence backed case based fear facts turned out very different individuals treated same distorted way then ve done ourselves damage than any terrorist organisation could bombs become animals too agree many ways what forsyth respected influence within world must seen walking walk well talking talk how accuse countries such zimbabwe burma human rights abuses locking well may totally innocent hypocrisy highest order forsyth links islamic fundamentalism new threat however appears misunderstood term islamic fundamentalism should pointed out muslim adheres true fundamentals qur aan teachings last prophet muhammad islamic fundamentalist person does commit suicide any shape form nor does kill innocent women men children person self reflective constantly tries better her actions being good others well forsyth labels new threat those follow correct teachings islam arrived own interpretations assumptions regards actions top claim following islam true form accept intentions policies make britain safer place cannot think single example history where doing sort thing ever made any difference northern ireland internment certainly didn t achieve anything bombings didn t stop could argued all achieved just supply ira yet angry resentful republicans willing take arms against british being eight years older than frederick forsyth survivor blitz london easy agree absolutely spot during ira bombings there

stone 17 old soul singer devon beat dizzee rascal jamelia lemar streets win best british urban act brit awards her victory reignited debate what urban music m really comfortable word urban word manufactured country america describe black music word urban seems cover such broad range black music wrong how far brits removed inner city music what well doing so far removed don t expect get bang music industry isn t championing music particular genre very well anyway well don t feel are anything don t feel are urban music just celebrated joss stone winning her being nominated brits acknowledging there urban music scene because all kick teeth end day really relevant joss stone closest thing feel comfortable championing because what looks are how sounds signed then so got nothing what really going urban genre very broad your look underneath urban there number core elements include hip hop r b garage obviously comes soul joss stone soul artist her first album called soul sessions so urban very broad brushstroke umbrella over top sub genres there offshoots all those joss stone amazing success given uk artist what really captured everybody imagination here your 17 old devon voice die bunch really really good tunes looks good think what done award best british urban act voted viewers mtv base don t think joss worthy winner makes soul music definitely comes under category what describe urban fact devon interesting thing because most music cover made large cities literally rural great thing urban music there big range there some sort root black music dance music britain think where your call urban where new sub category uber category come joss stone certainly old enough some experiences older soul singer your couldn t argue being inauthentic her emotions coming somewhere genuine come across real only cut off point here only way judge well what urban means organisation politically correct term describe music originated black background music should become inclusive fighting multi cultural britain then should fighting inclusion rather than exclusion joss stone accepted within urban music community think acts ethnicities doing classical music rock should accepted too race doesn t make difference everyone included out all awards dished out yesterday m still trying find out what well races received any sort recognition award type music especially street music originates city typically reflects characteristic urban life might urban r b become hip hop tainted thing now r b stands rhythm blues remember joss stone rubbish certain anyone deserves win award urban music think probably should include hip hop soul funk least rock pop streets although dizzee rascal stakes good claim definitely deserved win prize joss stone albums quite simply amazing easily better than anything else released last whole debate what urban what isnt urban completely pointless probably fueled urban artists weren t nominated didn t win cant see well t just congratulate her talent she deserve agree comments urban music stupid phrase particularly british states tend use hip hop r b say hip hop here lot well no idea what m talking very strange what name rose any name etc well call urban really analysed term dance music misleading because doesn t describe everything your dance whilst agree term urban open interpretation strikes me simply weird joss stone won urban me what hear being played parties inner cities live brixton never heard soul sessions pumping out of bass heavy sound system any parties ve good luck joss stone let celebrate her victory let question artists so successful talented jamelia lemar kanye west dizzee rascal alicia keys outkast didn t see single black artist stage collecting award so what your re saying any music black heritage allowed sung anyone isn t black then shouldn t acknowledged even re pretty dam good 17 amazing voice won good her oh black well let make her feel real bad then how dare though hang didn t so called public vote one idea pigeonholing whatever popular time no different than what happening 1940s 50s relation what jazz media then called anything swinging beat syncopated melody soulful feeling jazz much chagrin artists mean blues put same mould bebop cool ragtime all very different styles time jazz remains such massively misunderstood term so what urban music truth lazy term categorise music your don t really understand soul garage worlds apart musically marvin gaye tuff jam no doubt connections just let music speak itself judge success artist number awards won then maybe enjoy music what rather than what represents demand prize rural music sucks cities way better out here hay one thing excluding her what become known urban music bad excluding lenny kravitz hendrix rock music being black surely dont understand point ty making lemar makes music less soulful than joss work won might nothing btw m black too how urban spent most her life devon countryside nonsense love joss bits don t care what her branding amazing music full stop stop puting all brackets let just call music let especially drop black urban tag nearly all music came black origin just sets example ok pigeonhole well music colour surely point having urban music category simply acknowledge artists making what historically considered urban music irrelevent colour skin where originate joss stone simply singing certain type music considered urban style just someone inner city indeed usa could sing country music person good authentic sound criticise being referred country music artist representing style term urban reference music genre uk developed part controversy surrounding branding mobo awards very term music black origin confused offended many well particularly strange given existence asian music awards appears use black white relation music makes well feel uncomfortable term urban therefore invoked sidestep debate type music came first black white thereby rendering issue colourblind result now redundant new debate what urban means perhaps should created new term altogether describe various strains soul rnb hip hop one does mean something else done crunk urban just word come recently describe black music become popular now word wasn t even use common use five six years ago just way industry clumping all together without having call black music because some well oversensitive might call racist m band called urban despise label d hate think belonged any neat marketing niche because all ever since music channels record comapnies tried fracture what consider music black origin labels used undermine status good music commodity look all tv broadcasters unable reach young well without condesending simply play some urban music soundtrack some dreadful cheap lift music ignore labels what just music black man think agree some statements least statements made key executives black well should lead music invented should stop calling genre meaningless northing meaningless real question joss stone successful doing music doing done black same thing streets amy winehouse etc ever heard terri walker rhian benson both 10 times better than joss stone both won urban music awards think mobos brits so what joss stone won urban awards her music great soul surely under urban banner what streets won well whining because mike skinner white seems lot fuss race where real issue should music nothing else urban pc version saying black music m doubting ms stone talent didn t jamelia lemar get brit reminds me what happened craig david soul ii soul past getting nominations easy get picking brit seems hardest thing refreshing see well making reasonable intelligent comments any topic days power your well your there music your are music your don t are cares what label your put entire category mess how your well are dizzee rascal against joss stone are putting eminem against bob geldof should nominated best british r b act joss stone deserved win award her talents don t think very urban her sing angels robbie williams urban nonsense term music black origin well doesn t include rock music made inner cities well almost all bands end making music london manchester etc doesn t make some weird implication all black well live cities doesn t make any sense does music put genre music your are your don t simple play heavy metal band urban music far m concerned live cities spend working life urban environment therefore directly shapes what write musically urban seems new name all styles black music needed rebrand don t know name misleading oasis originate city characterise urban life know therefore than fit term urban yet re white rock band won t described such joss stone fantastic voice great timing delivery what reason need award her brit all urban such categorisation just red tape music business best ignored yeah deserved talented urban crap meaningless politically correct probably actually racist marketing term though there only two

groundbreaking presumably age range could bothered vote is pretty low m actually embarrassed british best song produced last 25 years what specials ghost town buzzcocks ever fallen love someone happy mondays kinky afro mcalmont butler yes joy division love tear apart angels middle road rubbish angels awful piece sentimental claptrap musically lyrically inept fantastically overrated bit are williams himself result isn t very surprising though brits long history celebrating rubbish music best last 25 years maybe cunning make timescale include stairway heaven bohemian rhapsody does kind make bit hollow award really much competition last 25 years after all alright pop song best song last 25 years there no way earth song should voted best last 25 years travesty rubbish voted included any list regular listener radio 2 don t recall invitation vote bland slushy rubbish might appeal masses wouldn t know good song jumped bit nose certainly best song last 25 years how depressing just thought manufactured pop way out where earth dreadful list appear while biassed thought love tear apart should won all seriousness think best song last 25 years should include songs less than 5 years old exclude songs popular because novelty then again well done robbie good show your ve got kidding angels great song best song last 25 years only best song nomination brits think angels great song deserved run award don t think best song past 25 years right enough better than some others catergory example what young doing being nominated first place alright song isn t good m happy robbie himself though best song last 25 years what joke think all great rock pop songs released 80s pretty much all better than angels phil collins doesn t deserve awards all good songs wrote angels overrated song got tiresome even before your finished listening soppy rubbish best hopefully manufactured rubbish die down soon let real artists worked hard there glory receive awards so boringly obvious typical bland nature mainstream music britain today me proof music democracy just don t mix still least wasn t young oh all just bit fun well take awards too seriously robbie millions loyal fans while even non fans know words angels winning obviously reflects votes awards personally wanted young win really due musical talent hate song all brings back memories school discos no one slow dance agree angels never get fed hearing whenever song comes radio turn radio smile sing along very badly radio turned drown my voice out song makes me calm serene happy well done robbie think although robbie williams good performer angels isn t really good song certainly isn t anywhere near good love tear apart joy division wuthering heights kate bush angels fantastic song all credit robbie williams guy chambers song played forever bridges all age groups robbie no way deserve mantle whenever awards always artists past five years seem win best best forget late 80s early 90s example weren t cool time because cool again now shows songs greater longevity than well think yes angels best song since past 25 years because touches soul carries lot meaning ve always disared angels intensely believe symbolic general capacity british pre teens teens middle aged women accept low quality low aspirational music classic songwriting orrible seems obvious me well are robbie well don t particularly are music all much folks without collections folks never engaged madness one experiences falling under spell pop music angels adds nothing merely irritating distraction wasp refuses away summer afternoon picnic what dreadful result your voted your should feel ashamed yourself your probably only know dozen songs so don t your so where get off applying uninformed filter casting ridiculous vote booo hisss angels best song your kidding right last five years might willing accept 25 no way whoever voted actually any music knowledge prior say 1995 really quite insulting british music industry past quarter century no surprise robbie williams considering list where earth nominations list come compiled eleven old girl perhaps mean young come what load crap best song last 25 years don t think so what all real artists out there over last 25 years list endless robbie williams doesn t even come close what joke song become such bane me developed pavlovian response word angels where thrash around scream no no no no no until someone tells me radio off half baked cheesy ditty are angels become anthem millions romantic sops think how many times sung pop idol example whom should voted best song past 25 years beyond me song against all others judged then musicians may well give reward mediocrity so highly country initial list very weak anyway angels best song last 25 years think didn t realize radio 2 so many listeners under age 10 well such short memories great song yes best last 25 years chance think person opposed song voted here great british public work again mediocre sentimental safe song granted too bad either stand against anything smiths particular how soon now anything stone roses first album nope no because m female m 10 ok are robbie angels decent song no way best song past 25 years shortlist wasn t great winning joke predictable laughable success angels years brits reflects poorly state british music over last 25 years british public brainwashed corporate pulp presneted cutting edge music true talent being sadly missed whilst angels popular song even best song robbie repertoire never mind best song last 25 years huge robbie fan love song think there lot outstanding songs music out there influenced music today unfortunately done left out list radio 2 listeners even heard joy division band are two albums bigger impact music continue so over last 25 years than robbie williams ever no doubt there song done anyone emotion feeling some well adopt slightly snobby stances angels hit home far larger audience than any song should joy division those guys played influential part shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song sincerely believe 25 years now most influential artists argue robbie williams inspired art way byrds beatles nick drake done music today yes think brilliantly written song different meanings different well there done great songs category somebody win robbie deserved winner astounded such second rate record beaten such line amazing songs terrible song voted masses don t brains appreciate innovative exciting music best song past 25 years really come surely joke no think need long lie down just goes show british public clue good quality music pick robbie williams over beautifully talented kate bush joy division suppose confirmed one thing british public consistently dull lt no offence robbie pleeease there must thousand better songs than formulated cheesy pop song kids no one agrees quite frankly embarassment integrity british music further nail coffin think robbie deserves most iconic any stars britain since john lennon idol millions worldwide anybody says doesn t deserve jealous success only real challenger queen hey another one bites dust obviously all karaoke singers uk voted best song last 25 years then british music industry trouble sure robbie talented produces excellent material best record sad day music type music normally are even diehard rock fan recognise good song appelas most well voted best song last 25 years good all rounder just are robbie best song 25 years since 1980 m confused angels isn t bad song nice catchy formulaic anthem ticks all boxes great music anything regressive bland even suppose just evidence how redundant brit awards become granted angels good song however really wasn t against any proper competition queen song lackluster apart kate bush choices done pathetic weren t stones there david bowie etc there so many greater songs than angels wonder simply fact robbie wasn t getting awards so make one best song last 25 years what ridiculuous concept even ridiculous winner sigh upside least wasn t bohemian rhapsody should all thankful angels without doubt great song really don t think deserves title best song 25 years perhaps vote teenage opinion robbies goodlooks than actual song don t get me wrong m disputing looks there deserved winners travesty angels won without angels robbie williams may well where now britain deprived one most charismatic talented performing artists seen performed live 125 well singing along fully appreciated well done rob find hard believe angels best show past 25 years m rapidly redifining best my own head now mean most gratuitously played weddings funerals because well think deep meaning what britpop blur oasis suede pulp only making fantastic songs making changes doing something different must best always come down most commercially popular ve nothing against robbie actually are music how possibly best song last 25year brits proved nothing than bargaining tool between pop moguls boost band profiles record sales same goes scissor sisters think superb record thoroughly deserves newcomer award album comes no where near u2 new record neither same league once again there some baffling discisions made artisic reasons profit no surprise really voted general public since taste music personally find angels robbie williams one most irritating songs ever heard absolutely deserved win song united generations continue played many years come absolute joke however most original 25 done very poor choices well all all pretty pointless exercise song overplayed oversentimental out rather poor five choices done left should gone either joy division queen suppose should thankful didn t end hands young though although nostalgia value there no way deserved win everybody knows words bohemian rhapsody nothing compares 2 u etc much better songs timeless give someone real talent although angels good song think anyone slightest musical taste realise
